That's a *work in progress* for **Cameron Workflow System** which aim to be a web-based process system able to handle multiple concurrent HTTP requests asking to run pre-defined processes, enqueue them and run them in parallel, as fast as possible.

To achive that objective, as you can see, it has been built as an Erlang/OTP application with a REST-like Web API, powered by Misultin, and a Redis-based backend database and queue system.
